# MCP-JsonCreator
It is a JavaFX application that allows you to easily create JSON files for Minecraft items. It simplifies the developer's work: he just has to enter the name of his item and choose the type of item, and choose the output folder. Once this is done the JSON will be created automatically. Please note the json is only compatible with the minecraft version of 1.8.8
